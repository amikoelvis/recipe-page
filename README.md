## My Process

### Built With

- **Semantic HTML5**
- **CSS Flexbox**

### What I Learned

One key takeaway from this project was styling lists using **custom bullets with CSS**:

```css
.recipe__ingredients-list li::marker {
    color: hsl(14, 45%, 36%);
    list-style-type: square;
}

### Continued development

In future projects, Iâ€™d like to:

- Improve CSS animations & transitions for better UX.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks - Custom List Markers](https://css-tricks.com/list-markers-and-string-styles/) - Helped with styling list markers.
